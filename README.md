# Hello-World
Learning platform
Brand new at this in MAC.  In studies at CTU, we coded C++, which at the time I always felt everything was over my head.  I passed and now I can appreciate learning to retain.  I repair computers systems and software issues in gui.  I'll really appreciate learning in this platform and I appreciate learning code.
